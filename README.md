# Frontend Server

Simulate Discord's frontend server for local (use with Legacery/Reflectcord) or remote (like a frontend server for Spacebar)

(Updating this soon because this is old af)

## Compiling and using

Be sure that port 4000 is open. (or change it in config.yaml)

1. Compile, go to the root directory and run

```
npm i
npm run build
```

2. Create a `build` directory and insert the build assets and index.html into it.

3. Run `npm run start`
